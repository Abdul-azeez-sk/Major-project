        <h3>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Agriculture is one of the most crucial industries, yet farmers often face challenges in determining the best time to harvest their crops for maximum profit. This project integrates machine learning, IoT-based real-time sensor data, and predictive analytics to help farmers optimize their harvesting window while maximizing revenue by forecasting market price trends.</p>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The project focuses on three key components:
            <br>
            *Price Trend Prediction using machine learning<br>
            *Strategic Harvesting Window Optimization<br>
            *Real-Time Sensor Monitoring through IoT<br>
            These components work together to enhance decision-making, ensuring that crops are harvested at the right time while maintaining quality and profitability.

        <h3>1. Price Trend Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Market price fluctuations significantly impact farmers' income. To address this, we employ machine learning models to predict future crop prices based on various parameters such as:
            <br><br>
            *Historical market prices<br>
            *Weather conditions<br>
            *Government policies<br>
            *Supply and demand trends<br>
            How it Works:<br>
            We collect past market data from agricultural databases and APIs.
            We preprocess the data and apply time-series forecasting models such as LSTM, ARIMA, or Prophet.
            The trained model provides future price estimates that farmers can use to determine the best-selling period.
            <br><br>
             Example: If the model predicts that the price of wheat will rise by 10% in the next two weeks, farmers can delay harvesting to gain more profit.

        <h3>2. Window Harvesting Optimization</h3>
        <p>
            Not all crops should be harvested at the same time. The harvesting window depends on multiple factors, including:
            <br><br>
            *Market price trends (from the ML model)<br>
            *Crop maturity levels<br>
            *Weather conditions<br>
            *Storage capabilities<br>
            How it Works:<br>
            We use optimization algorithms to recommend the best harvesting time based on price forecasts and crop conditions.
            Farmers receive alerts via a web dashboard or mobile app, advising them on whether to harvest now or wait for better prices.<br>
            The system also considers supply chain factors, ensuring the crops reach the market at the right time.
            <br><br> 
            Example: If the temperature is predicted to be stable for the next week and prices are expected to increase, the system will suggest delaying the harvest.

        <h3>3. IoT-Based Real-Time Sensor Signaling</h3>
        <p>
            IoT devices installed in greenhouses or farms sends real-time data on environmental factors such as:
            <br><br>
            *Temperature<br>
            *Humidity<br>
            *Soil moisture<br>
            *COâ‚‚ levels<br>
            *How it Works:<br>
            The IoT sensors continuously send data to the cloud.
            Data is integrated with machine learning models to further refine harvest timing predictions.
